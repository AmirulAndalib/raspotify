Description: An interactive utility that generates a very simple /etc/asound.conf.
 # asound-conf-wizard
 .
 asound-conf-wizard is an interactive utility that generates a very simple
 `/etc/asound.conf`.
 .
 It is designed to be used on headless sytems that run bare ALSA.
 .
 It will **NOT** run on systems that have PulseAudio, Jack Audio or PipeWire
 installed. **That is by design.**
 .
 You should use those to configure audio if they are installed.
 .
 ## Limitations
 .
 asound-conf-wizard is intentionally very simple and it generates a very basic
 `/etc/asound.conf` that (ideally) creates a default duplex device with full
 software conversion and mixing for both Playback and Capture. If your use case
 is more niche and/or complex then that asound-conf-wizard is not for you.
 .
 asound-conf-wizard suports `hw:`, `hdmi:` `iec958:` ALSA PCMs, `U8` and
 depending on the platform either the `LE` or `BE` varants of `S16`, `S24_3`,
 `S24` and `S32` formats and any number of channels and sampling rates.
 Basically it supports what `dmix` and `dsnoop` both support.
 .
 ## Usage
 .
 asound-conf-wizard requires write privileges to `/etc`.
 .
 Other then that, basically just run the binary and follow the prompts.
