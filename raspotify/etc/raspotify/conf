# /etc/raspotify/conf -- Arguments/configuration for librespot

# A non-exhaustive list of librespot options and flags.

# Please see:
# - https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify/wiki
# - https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options
# for configuration details and a full list of options and flags.

# You can also find a full list with `librespot -h`.

# To avoid name collisions environment variables must be prepended with
# `LIBRESPOT_`, so option/flag `foo-bar` becomes `LIBRESPOT_FOO_BAR`.

# Invalid environment variables will be ignored.

# Raspotify defaults may vary from librespot defaults.

# Boolean values are represented as flags, which are either enabled
# (uncommented) or disabled (commented, default). Note that `off` is considered
# as TRUE and should not be used.

# Commenting out the environment variable will fallback to librespot's default
# unless otherwise noted.

# Empty values for string variables may cause errors.

###########################################
# This is NOT a librespot option or flag. #

# This modifies the behavior of the Raspotify service.
# If you have issues with this option DO NOT file a bug with librespot.
# 
# By default librespot "download buffers" tracks, meaning that it downloads
# the tracks to disk and plays them from the disk and then deletes them when
# the track is over. This practice is very common, many other audio frameworks
# and players do the exact same thing as a disk based tmp cache is easy to use
# and very resilient. That being said there may be cases where a user may want
# to minimize disk read/writes.
#
# Commenting this out will cause librespot to use a tmpfs so that provided there
# is enough RAM to hold the track nothing is written to disk but instead to a tmpfs.
# See https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify/discussions/567
# And https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html
